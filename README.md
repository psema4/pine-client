# pine-client

## Synopsis

This is what most would consider the front-end to "Pine".  It's an AngularJS + Express powered app that loads and runs HTML5 games on your Raspberry Pi.

*pine-client* is intended to be run from the home directory of the *pine-distro*'s 'pine' user.  The front-end proper (AngularJS) communicates with an express server which provides it with HTML5, media and some system services (such as sound).

*pine-client* communicates with a central *pine-server* (online store, community hub) using RESTful API's.

**FIXME:** Fill in, add standalone launcher info
